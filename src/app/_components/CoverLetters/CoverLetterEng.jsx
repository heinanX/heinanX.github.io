      <h3>Hiya, nice to see you back here!</h3>

        Let&apos;s just dive right into it, yea? I have a background in Graphic Design, and since May 2024, I am also a
        trained full-stack developer.

        The reason why I love to code, is because it&apos;s the perfect blend of{" "}
        <b>creativity</b> and <b>logic</b>. Like a writer, I see each project as
        a unique story that takes you on a new journey every time; a journey
        where you have to overcome{" "}
        <span className="line-through">sometimes</span> frustrating obstacles,
        explore exciting new techniques, use reliable methods, or just look at
        things through new perspectives.

      <p className="pb-6 leading-8">
        Curiosity has always been a driving force for me. I see adventure in
        everyday life and set high standards for my performance, taking pride in
        what I deliver. With a long history of working retail, I thrive in team environments but am equally confident
        when working on solo projects.
